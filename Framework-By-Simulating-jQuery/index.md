# A framework simulating jQuery



#### jQuery is a very popular frame, and find the how it is work is very important for JS skill improvement. Here I just realize some basic function, and simulate it in middle level. Because Selector is a very important part in jQuery, I seperate this part from my framework, RickHFramework.js,firstly, and then provide the whole framework including SelectorRickH module. The framework will contain following contents:

1.  Selector module
2.  Dom module
3.  Event module
4.  Style module
5.  Attribute module
6.  Animation module, 

###### I focus on the Selector module, and also import the Sizzle module from jQuery in my sample.
